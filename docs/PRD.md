# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Project**: Claude Desktop Interface (Electron/Tauri MVP)
**Owner**: TBD
**Last Updated**: 2023-XX-XX

---

## 1. Overview
A cross-platform desktop application that provides a friendly GUI for interacting with Claude via the Claude CLI and optionally Claude Code, designed for non-technical users. The app bundles necessary CLI tooling, supports the latest models, and delivers an easy chat and coding experience.

## 2. Goals
- Deliver a minimal, intuitive interface for chatting with Claude.
- Support Windows, macOS, and Linux out of the box.
- Replace command-line interactions with a GUI that accesses the latest Claude models.
- Enable multi-threaded conversations with optional sub-agents.
- Provide basic integration with Claude Code for code navigation/editing.
- Collect usage analytics and error reports for continual improvement.
- Maintain high standards for security, privacy, and automatic updates.

## 3. Non-Goals
- Advanced theming/branding beyond a minimal default look.
- Offline functionality (app requires internet for model access).
- Plugin system or third-party integrations in the MVP.
- Full IDE features beyond basic Claude Code interactions.

## 4. Target Users
- Non-coders and casual users who want an easy way to chat with Claude.
- Technical users who prefer a GUI to the CLI.
- Early adopters interested in Claude's sub-agents and Claude Code features.

## 5. Assumptions
- All users have a valid Claude API key.
- Users are connected to the internet when using the app.
- Electron or Tauri can package the CLI and run on all major desktop OSs.

## 6. MVP Feature Set
### 6.1 Cross-Platform Support
- Build using Electron (fallback to Tauri if Electron cannot meet requirements).
- Distribute installers for Windows (.exe), macOS (.dmg), and Linux (.AppImage or .deb/.rpm).

### 6.2 Bundled Claude CLI
- Ship with the CLI pre-packaged so users don’t need a separate installation.
- On launch, app fetches available Claude models and stores metadata locally.

### 6.3 Chat Interface
- Single-window design with:
  - Message input area.
  - Chat transcript area (supports markdown/inline code).
  - Model selector (auto-populated from latest fetch).
- Ability to start and manage multiple threads:
  - Threads appear in a sidebar list.
  - Users can rename or delete threads.
  - Chat windows run in parallel, even if background ones are still receiving responses.
- Sub-agents:
  - Within any chat, users can spawn sub-agents that operate on a sub-thread.
  - Sub-agents can be promoted to full threads.

### 6.4 Claude Code Integration
- Optional “Code Mode” toggle per thread:
  - When enabled, user can open local files or folders.
  - Basic file tree view and content preview.
  - Ability to send file contents or diffs to Claude.
  - Save suggestions back to disk (confirmation dialog before write).

### 6.5 Conversation Storage
- Chats (including sub-threads) are stored locally in JSON or SQLite.
- Local files encrypted at rest using OS-level keychain APIs.
- Setting to disable history storage (auto-delete on app close).

### 6.6 API Key & Authentication
- First launch prompts for API key.
- Key stored securely (OS keychain or encrypted file).
- Settings panel allows viewing, replacing, or deleting the key.

### 6.7 Auto-Update Mechanism
- App checks for updates on launch and periodically (e.g., daily).
- Silent download in background; prompt to restart when ready.
- Fail gracefully if update server unreachable.

### 6.8 Telemetry & Analytics
- Collect anonymous usage metrics: feature usage, session duration, basic OS info.
- Capture crash reports and unhandled errors.
- Provide an opt-out toggle in settings.

### 6.9 Security & Privacy
- All stored data encrypted at rest.
- No conversation data sent to servers other than Claude’s API.
- Clear privacy policy accessible from settings.
- Option to delete all local data.

## 7. Functional Requirements
| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| F1 | App packages and invokes Claude CLI internally | Must |
| F2 | Model list fetched on startup and selectable per thread | Must |
| F3 | Start, rename, delete, and run multiple chat threads concurrently | Must |
| F4 | Spawn sub-agents within a thread | Must |
| F5 | Claude Code mode: open files, send to Claude, accept return edits | Should |
| F6 | Chats stored locally, encrypted; user can disable or clear history | Must |
| F7 | Secure API key entry and storage | Must |
| F8 | Automatic updates with user notification | Must |
| F9 | Basic telemetry + crash reporting with opt-out | Must |
| F10 | Settings panel (API key, telemetry toggle, data management) | Must |

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Initial launch <3s on modern hardware. Prompt response to user interactions (<150ms UI latency).
- **Reliability**: 99% crash-free sessions; robust error handling for CLI failures.
- **Security**: No plaintext storage of API keys or chat logs. Use OS-level secure storage.
- **Usability**: No more than two clicks from app launch to first message.
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation for all UI elements; screen reader friendly labels.
- **Localization**: English only in MVP.

## 9. Architecture & Technology Notes
- **Framework**: Electron preferred; investigate Tauri if Electron fails to meet size/performance goals.
- **Frontend**: React or Vue with a lightweight component library (e.g., Tailwind or MUI).
- **State Management**: Redux/Context (React) or Pinia/Vuex (Vue).
- **Storage**: SQLite for conversations; secure storage API for keys.
- **Telemetry**: Use a lightweight analytics service or self-hosted endpoint.
- **Auto-Update**: Electron’s autoUpdater module or equivalent in Tauri.

## 10. Metrics & Success Criteria
- **Activation**: % of users who send at least one message after installation.
- **Retention**: Weekly active users over first month.
- **Stability**: Crash rate per session.
- **Feature Usage**: % of threads created with Code Mode enabled; sub-agent usage.
- **Opt-Out Rate**: % of users disabling telemetry or history storage.

## 11. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Cross-platform inconsistencies | Continuous testing on all OSs |
| Model API changes | Fetch models dynamically; version checks |
| CLI packaging size | Investigate Tauri or compression techniques |
| Data privacy concerns | Clear policy, encrypted storage, opt-out options |

## 12. Open Questions / Future Considerations
- Should we support theming (light/dark) in MVP or future release?
- Is two-factor authentication for API key rotation needed?
- What’s the roadmap for deeper Claude Code integration (e.g., debugging, IDE plugins)?
- Possible plugin marketplace or extension system later?
- Export/share conversations (PDF, Markdown) in later iterations.
